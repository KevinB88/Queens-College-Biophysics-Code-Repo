This will be done for different values of W.

The following is the procedure which will be done to
properly calculate the MFPT.

Compute for global maximum of the graph of the
mass loss rate with respect to time.

Then multiply the current number of time-steps by a factor of 5.

Use this is in the computation for MFPT.

The computation for MFPT is done for varying values of W

Keep trying this for larger and larger values of W,
you should begin to notice the curve begin to stabilize
over successively large values.

Keep running this algorithm for a varying number of
microtubule placements.


Find the time step associated to the global max
of the mass-loss-rate graph
